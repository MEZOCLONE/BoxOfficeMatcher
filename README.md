BoxOfficeMatcher
================

BoxOfficeMatcher downloads the most popular movies and shows them into the movies list.

If you want to launch directly the movie information, use the Matcher view to scan the poster.

Through the list, or through the matcher, launch the Movie Extra Info Screen. 

You will read the synopsis, ratings and extra info. 

Also a direct link to the trailer and to the TMDB webpage.

The project integrates ARLab Image Matching SDK to recognize the movie poster images real time.
